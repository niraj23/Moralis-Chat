# Moralis Chat
Metaverse is a “shared virtual environment that people access via the Internet”. 
The technology creates a set of virtual spaces where people can immerse themselves through 
holograms/avatars to make it feel like they are in the same physical space. 
However we've build a chat app using `react-js` `next-js` `taiwand-css` and `moralis`. 
Moralis provides us the backend support for storing and retrieving data from blockchain.
